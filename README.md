A few tools meant to help fill the gaps in Unitys UGUI and EventSystem setup. 
- Draggable UI Object and matching Node script: Allows objects to be dragged, dropped, and installed seemlessly along other ui elements like buttons and sliders.
- Virtual Pointer system: Adds an abstraction layer between the EventSystem/InputModule, and a Virtual Pointer gameobject allowing gamepad support and added input flexibility


Project Requirements
- Unity Editor 2022.3.21f1 or later
- Input system 1.7 or later
