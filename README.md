A few tools meant to help fill the gaps between Unity's EventSystem and Input System.
- Draggable Object and matching Node script: Allows objects to be dragged, dropped, and installed seemlessly along other ui elements like buttons and sliders.
- Virtual Pointer system: Adds an abstraction layer between the EventSystem/InputModule, and a Virtual Pointer gameobject allowing gamepad support and added input flexibility
- Cursor Manager: Handles visual state of cursor
- Helpers: A few helper scripts to assist with common tasks
